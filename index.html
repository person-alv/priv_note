    <p>Becca, you are an amazing person and to be honest, being around u is fun and I enjoy every minute about it, from your laugh 
        to this cute face u make sometimes to when your thoughts get flustered when you're talking about something. I honestly didn't imagine
        that one day, having met you that I'd be doing some crazy shit like this. But I guess shit happens right ? You know before I made this, I had all the
        words but typng them right now, makes me feel like sometimes u don't really have things handled. I love how goofy you are, how u are mature and yet
        so childish that it makes me fold sometimes. I love that you have this naughty side that you've had me see and experience in one
        way or another and the warmth I feel everytime you hold my hand, every time u want me around u, every time u take snaps of us that I love but I have to pretend
        that I haven't seen them coz I'd look awkward being the guy who sucks at photos that I am, th way u fall asleep
        on my arm so calm and I can feel u rest and be comfortable is a feeling that I wouldn't trade for any other.

        Anyway, I know you're pretty much wondering, to what aim is he saying all this, is it that he's dying ? Is it that it's a goodbye note or something ?
        naaahhh none. Lemme explain, I love coding sooo much. its stressful but I like it. I like it because, I have control, I like it 
        coz code and machines never dissapoint, never make me think too much, never make me nervous. I simply put in instructions and it carries
        them out exactly how I said it. Unlike code like this one is in, hearts don't work that way, as much as I'd like them to, they simply don't Becca.
        I wish they did because then attachment wouldn't be a thing, losing control wouldn't be a thing. It's what makes us humans but it sucks sometimes.
        So in all of us hanging out, and being the way we are, I've tried sooooo hard, I've tried and tried and tried again, though unfortunately,
        the heart wants.......what the heart wants. Its something that I'm sure makes you uncomfortable but well....it happened. I kinda got 
        attached, its something that you don't want but tough....

        Its been a really confusing ride to be honest, a confusion that brought me happiness like Karura and soooooo much bliss in my heart, likewise, a confusion that unlike code,
I couldn't wrap my head around and that truly hurts me. Although u made it clear that its not within possibility that "us" could ever be for one reason or the other
maybe I'm boring, maybe you're scared it wouldn't work, maybe I jus don't excite you and that's fine. I want to be the way I am with u these days still every single day
holding hands, being cute and all couple goals but I was thinking, at what cost, in time, ni mimi nitaumia na sitaki coz the more I'm with u, the more I can't help it.
I'm only human Becca. So, in light of such, We can't have Saturday and to be honest it brings me pain saying this coz I want it so bad but sijui itaniacha nikiskia aje
afterwards and u may make my day but you'll be happy at home and I'll be dealing with my emotions alone. So I have to make this really really tough choice. Though our 
friendship is unaffected in every way and everything is still the same, I jus needed to get this out of my chest. If u think about it, its like a long text, I jus got u to
read it in a fancy way, I jus didn't know any other way to get this out without losing my cool or expressing myself half way
by simply looking into your eyes. So yeah Thanks for reading, Its the only way I knew how.
